        answer1: "NSTSE is a diagnostic test which helps students improve their overall learning ability and educational performance.Unlike other tests which may only find out how much a student knows or has memorised, NSTSE measures how well a student has understood the concepts and provides a detailed feedback on the same, to help him/ her improve.Thus NSTSE helps each student to know early, whether he / she has properly understood a concept, so that immediate action can be taken to correct the aberration and pave a path for improvement.Often, students develop conceptual gaps which increase as the students go to higher classes and turn those into a ‘phobia’for the subject",
        answer2: "There will be a separate question paper for each class.The medium of the exam will be in English only.All questions are in objective-type with no negative marking for wrong answers.",
